## Transform The Noise Into A Pattern

This repo is for the paper "Transform The Noise Into A Pattern", for any usage of the code please cite the original paper in the work.

## Requirements
This project need the following packages:
```
Pytorch >=1.8 (cuda version)
torch_optimizer==0.1.0
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
h5py
```
For torch_optimizer version >0.1.0 the Radam is removed and merged into pytorch>=1.9. We prefer to use the following command
`!pip3 install torch_optimizer==0.1.0`
to guarantee it works.
